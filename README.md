In the final weeks of the course, we were each tasked with creating an 8-15 screen high-fidelity app prototype.
The app was required to provide information on mozzarella, Gruyere, Parmesan, Roquefort, and cheddar, and how to use them.

Delta Cheese was designed for young or inexperienced home cooks aged 18-34 lacking knowledge about cheese and how it can be used in cooking.
Because the target users are inexperienced, I aimed to create an easy-to-understand and concise source of information that would not overwhelm someone unfamiliar with types of cheeses.
Focusing on the ‘deltas,’ or what’s distinct about each cheese, the app helps the user quickly see the few key things they need to know without being bogged down by less critical information.
The user will immediately be able to put this basic information to use in their cooking, and also gain a foundation of understanding to give them confidence when learning about other cheeses.
